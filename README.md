[![CI](https://github.com/sppidy/janus/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sppidy/janus/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Open-source paper-trading platform spanning **Indian equities (NSE)** and **Forex**, with a shared HTTP + WebSocket contract powering web, desktop, and Android clients.

This is a **meta-repo**: every component is its own git submodule with its own license, CI, and issue tracker.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Paper-trading only — no live order code is wired. Not financial advice. Trading involves risk.

## Layout

| Path | Repo | Stack | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`nse-agent/`](https://github.com/sppidy/janus-nse-agent) | sppidy/janus-nse-agent | Python, CatBoost | NSE trading agent (rule-based + LLM + ML) |
| [`nse-backend/`](https://github.com/sppidy/janus-nse-backend) | sppidy/janus-nse-backend | FastAPI, uvicorn | Single-user backend wrapping `nse-agent` |
| [`web/`](https://github.com/sppidy/janus-web) | sppidy/janus-web | Vanilla JS | Dashboard served by `nse-backend` at `/dashboard` |
| [`windows/`](https://github.com/sppidy/janus-desktop) | sppidy/janus-desktop | WinUI 3 / .NET 8 | Desktop client |
| [`android/`](https://github.com/sppidy/janus-android) | sppidy/janus-android | Kotlin / Jetpack Compose | Mobile client |
| [`forex-agent/`](https://github.com/sppidy/janus-forex-agent) | sppidy/janus-forex-agent | Python | Forex agent (ICT-style strategies) |
| [`forex-backend/`](https://github.com/sppidy/janus-forex-backend) | sppidy/janus-forex-backend | FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Docker | Multi-user forex backend |

## Architecture

```
Web dashboard ─┐
Desktop app ───┤     ┌── NSE backend (single-user, in-memory jobs)
Android app  ──┼────►│      └── dynamically imports nse-agent modules
               │     │
               └────►└── Forex backend (multi-user, PostgreSQL, Docker)
                              └── imports forex-agent modules
```

All three clients speak the **same HTTP + WebSocket contract**. Each stores per-profile base URL + API key, so one client binary flips between NSE main, NSE eval, and Forex backends without rebuild.

Full architectural reference: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Getting started

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sppidy/janus.git
cd janus
```

Full setup is in [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md) — one-page guide covering the NSE path, the Forex path, client builds, and the production hardening checklist.

## CI / build

Workflows live in [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows):

| File | What it builds |
| --- | --- |
| `ci.yml` | pytest for `nse-agent` + `nse-backend`; `compileall` smoke for forex agent/backend; gradle unit tests for `android/`; asset-presence check for `web/` |
| `android-build.yml` | Debug + signed release APK from `android/` (uses `RELEASE_*` GH secrets) |
| `desktop-build.yml` | msbuild Release x64 of the WinUI solution under `windows/` |
